## Overview

Having more than 100 active ads agency Adoro.us approached us to looking to build their own AI powered automated keyword generator.

New keyword generator will help them to save time and make more money using an intelligent ad management process that automates keyword research & analysis, campaign creation, and ongoing ad monitoring & optimization.

We built a custom crawler that would scrape the client's website for the latest products and trends and then feed them into the OpenAI API and Google keyword planner API via an algorithm. The algorithm would then generate a list of keywords that we would use to create ads for our clients.

To optimise their feed quality score we used an innovative technique. We integrated the keyword generator with the client's website, sopify and google sheets and used the data from those sources to generate keywords. This allowed us to generate keywords that were more relevant to the client's website and therefore more likely to be clicked on.
