## Overview

In 2021, Neardeals was conceived with the vision to revolutionize the way people buy, sell, and trade services and products online. Officially registered in Bangladesh in 2022, Neardeals set ambitious goals to launch a transformative online marketplace by 2024.

Originating in Poland, the company is now headquartered at 7 Temasek Blvd, Singapore, with a commitment to global expansion and a notable social impact mission. Neardeals' first significant milestone is the launch in Dhaka, Bangladesh, marking the beginning of its nationwide and eventually international reach.

To achieve this, Neardeals partnered with Qproco Pvt. Ltd. to develop an app-based platform that allows users to easily buy, sell, and trade with nearby users. The platform also enables users to create buyer requests, attracting sellers who can meet their needs.
