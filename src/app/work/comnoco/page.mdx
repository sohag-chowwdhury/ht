## Overview

Noticing incredibly complex backend development, the team at Comnoco came to the conclusion that, instead of having a monolithic backend, they needed to improve their backend development process. They wanted to create a no-code platform that would allow users to create and connect APIs without writing any code.

Previously they were using a monolithic backend that was difficult to maintain and scale. They wanted to follow Microservices architecture to make their backend more modular and scalable. They also wanted to automate their deployment process to reduce downtime and increase development productivity.

To achieve this, we design a microservices architecture to make their backend more modular and scalable. We automated their deployment process to reduce downtime and increase development productivity.
